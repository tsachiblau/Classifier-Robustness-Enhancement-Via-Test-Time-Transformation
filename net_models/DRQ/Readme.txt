Newest version of the code will be available on github after publication
Some of the functionalities that are not needed to reproduce the experiments have been removed for simplification
(e.g., model training)

Arguments of main:
--experiment_path (save dir of experiments)
--data_path (dir of data e.g., cifar10 folder; note that data heavy experiments are also saved in this dir)
--yaml_file (the experiment that is run; name of yaml file e.g., cifar10)
